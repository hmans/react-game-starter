# react-game-starter

> **Warning** Work in Progress!

- [Open in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/hmans/react-game-starter?file=README.md)
- [Open in CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/hmans/react-game-starter/main?file=/README.md)

### Goals

- To provide a solid starting template for React- and Three.js-powered games;
- To act as a sanity check for the libraries used;
- To prove that React game development is a thing (and one of beauty!);
- To surface good patterns and a sane and scalable project structure.

### Getting Started

You can use the links above to open the game in an online editor, where you can make your own changes and create your own fork. But you can also, of course, just clone the entire thing to your local computer:

```sh
npx degit hmans/react-game-starter mygame
cd mygame
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### A Note on the Project Structure

At some point in the future, this README will contain a more detailed tour through the project, but at the moment, things are still too much in flux. Most importantly, you should be aware that the `src/lib/` folder is currently a huge
grab-bag of _stuff_ that should (and in many cases will) be extracted into new and existing libraries.
