# react-game-starter

> **Warning** Work in Progress!

- [Open in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/hmans/react-game-starter?file=README.md)
- [Open in CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/hmans/react-game-starter/main?file=/README.md)

### Goals

- To provide a solid starting template for React- and Three.js-powered games;
- To act as a sanity check for the libraries used;
- To prove that React game development is a thing (and one of beauty!);
- To document and demonstrate a sane and scalable project structure.

### Getting Started

You can use the links above to open the game in an online editor, where you can make your own changes and create your own fork. But you can also, of course, just clone the entire thing to your local computer:

```sh
npx degit hmans/react-game-starter mygame
cd mygame
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Roadmap

- [x] Bootstrap a new Vite/R3F/etc. app
- [ ] A simple Miniplex setup that steers entities and effects
- [ ] Input through Controlfreak (and later Input Composer)
- [ ] A simple high-level structure driven by State Composer
- [ ] VFX driven by VFX Composer
- [ ] Some shader effects driven by Shader Composer
- [ ] Sound effects and music
